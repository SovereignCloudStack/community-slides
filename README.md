## Reveal Playground for SCS

This repo holds a playground for providing slides made with [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) for SCS.
Once the groundwork is done, the repo will be renamed and will hold further slidesets.

### Howto

* There is a `master` branch that holds upstream revealjs.
* There is a `scs-template` branch which holds the scs theme and where the `master` branch is regularly merged into.

If you want to create a new slideset, choose the template-branch you want to base on (for now, there is only `scs-template`) and branch of that. 
If you want to create a template slideset that is personalized, name it `scs-<github-username>-template`.

### Branch naming conventions

For slidedecks use the following naming convention: `slides/<year>-eventname`.
